//! Explicit Tokio runtime for hyperlight-analysis.
//!
//! Using an explicit runtime avoids conflicts with napi-rs's implicit runtime
//! and other native addons (like hyperlight-js) that may also create runtimes.
//!
//! This approach fixes SIGSEGV crashes caused by race conditions between
//! multiple tokio runtimes competing for async task execution.
